    <h3>About Me</h3>

    <p>
      Hi, I’m Serena. I grew up in Beijing, China, and am currently a senior at Whitman College, majoring in Economics–Mathematics with a minor in Music. 
      I’m interested in storytelling through data and plan to pursue a Master’s degree in Business Analytics.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over my four years in College, I have built experience in analytical tools such as Python, R, SQL, and Excel, 
      and have worked on research projects that strengthened both my analytical and writing skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my spare time, I enjoy playing and making music. I play guitar, piano, and a little bit of drums, and I’m especially interested in music production.
    </p>

    <p>
      Welcome to my personal portfolio. This site will showcase my projects, research, and work that reflect my interests and growth.
