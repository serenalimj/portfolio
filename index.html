    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
      Hi, I’m Serena. I grew up in Beijing, China, and am currently a senior at Whitman College, majoring in Economics–Mathematics with a minor in Music. 
      I’m interested in storytelling through data and plan to pursue a Master’s degree in Business Analytics.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over my four years in College, I have built experience in analytical tools such as Python, R, SQL, and Excel, 
      and have worked on research projects that strengthened both my analytical and writing skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my spare time, I enjoy playing and making music. I play guitar, piano, and a little bit of drums, and I’m especially interested in music production.
    </p>

    <p>
      Welcome to my personal portfolio. This site will showcase my projects, research, and work that reflect my interests and growth.

      <h2>Research</h2>

      <h3>The Accounting Needs and Software Used by Non-profit Organizations</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Research Question: </strong> What are the accounting needs of non-profit organizations and what software are available to meet these needs?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Overview:</strong> Nonprofit organizations (NPOs) are private entities that operate for collective social benefit, 
        typically directed at a particular group of clients or beneficiaries [Hall and O’Dwyer, 2017]. 
        Unlike commercial organizations, which aim to maximize their monetary profit, 
        nonprofit organizations aim to achieve social objectives rather than generate profit. 
        Thus, there is no standardized financial metric to assess their performance [Hall and O’Dwyer, 2017]. 
        Due to limitations in measurement standards, NPOs face challenges in accounting for funds, allocating resources, 
        and tracking donations and grants. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Collaboration:</strong> This research was conducted in collaboration with professor Veeramoothoo and fellow student researcher Carly Martin at Whitman College.
        We evaluated several accounting software solutions used by nonprofits—including <em>QuickBooks for Non-Profits, 
        Sage Intacct, Blackbaud Financial Edge NXT, Aplos, Zoho Books,</em> and <em>Xero</em>—and 
        compared their pricing and functionalities.
      </p>
      <p>
        The resulting paper provides guidance for thousands of small nonprofit organizations seeking to choose accounting software that meets their operational and reporting needs.

      <h2>Projects</h2>

      <h3>Interactive Economic Website Development</h3>
      <p>
      A multi-user online interactive game simulating real-world economic decision-making. Each player is
embedded in a unique social network, where their final payoff depended only on connected players’ choices—
allowing students to experience and understand the concept of public goods in practice.
